**Software Engineer** and **Security Researcher** 

I’ve decided to leave GitHub due to several critical concerns about the platform’s practices:

1.	Lack of Privacy: GitHub has repeatedly shown a disregard for user privacy, and this is something I cannot support.
2.	Unilateral Repository Deletions: GitHub has the ability to delete any repositories without notice, which undermines the stability and trust in their service.
3.	Contradictory Policies: While claiming to support open source, GitHub has engaged in hypocritical actions by restricting or removing various open-source projects, which is against the true spirit of the community.

Given these reasons, I can no longer align myself with a platform that compromises the values of privacy, stability, and open-source freedom. Thank you to everyone who has supported my work here. You can continue to follow my projects on <https://git.fz0x1.wtf>.
